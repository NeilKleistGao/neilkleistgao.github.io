It has been three years since the five kinds of super bacteria started to spread wildly.And the global population is reduced to ███,███,███.
Today a great progress has been made in LAB-██:
Unexpectedly,one special human cell evolve to a "Super Cell".The cell can
secrete bactericidal substance
 to resist the super bacteria,and consume its culture medium to get recovery and improve itself.
However,it can't divide for unknown reason.
Now,the cell becomes the last human cell in the culture medium,but is still resisting.Could it survive and become the final hope for human being?We will keep on observing...

We made up a pretty scary background to match our simple and cold artstyle.
Consuming your space is not so dangerous at the start of the game,but as you are facing more and more enemies and you have to consume more space,it could be easy to be besieged by enemies.

P.S. The game does allow you to trap the enemies in a circle by consuming space,but we don't recommend you to do that because it will greatly extend the time of one round.If you have done that unintentionally,you can just press esc to back to title.
